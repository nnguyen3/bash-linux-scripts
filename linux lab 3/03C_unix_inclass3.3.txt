Next Exercise:

First, make sure to have a gzipped file ready. Any file will do. Just gzip if first.

(1) Write simple script with an if/then

a. Make a script called store_data.sh that asks the user for a file name, 
checks to see if the file exists, then echos the name of the file.

b. Make the file executable (chmod 755 is one way) and execute it.
Use store_data.sh to backup a text file.

(2) Improve the script
If the file exists the bash script should
  1. Make a directory called SEQDATA
  2. Copy the file to SEQDATA
  3. gunzip the file in SEQDATA
  4. Run head on the file

(3) Try moving the script to /usr/local/bin
